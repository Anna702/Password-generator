# Password-generator

An application that can be used to generate a random password based on selected criteria.

## Description

This repository was created to fulfill a JavaScript challenge provided by the EdX Bootcamp. The challenge involves developing an application that enables an employee to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected by modifying starter code. The application presents a series of prompts for password criteria, including the desired password length and character types.

The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It boasts a clean and polished user interface that is responsive and adapts to multiple screen sizes.
